###About Me###
My general target is to become front end developer. Last year I decided to change my professional field and start studying as a developer. I started with self-study: I watched courses on YouTube, read books, resolved tasks. The next degree was course "Web-application development basics" in BelHard Academy. We studied HTML & CSS there. But on that moment, I understood that I know more in these disciplines and became learn Javascript. These year I graduated course of basic Javascript in Belhard Academy. Everyday I spend about two hours for study, every day I trying to know something new, to take some experience. I consider myself a purposeful person and will do everything possible to realize my dream/.
